        "overview":"Christmas in the charming town of Briar Falls will be bittersweet this year when architect Nell goes back to her hometown having been given the job of turning the historic Majestic Playhouse into a modern multiplex, much to the town\u2019s objections. The Playhouse has been home to their annual Christmas tableaux, which will now have to end after a long and historic tradition to the town. This job is Nell\u2019s first promotion, and one she wishes she hadn\u2019t been chosen for, especially when she meets the new owner of the theater, Connor, whose vision and ideas clash with Nell\u2019s. Since Connor hasn\u2019t had much experience celebrating Christmas, Nell hopes that if she can give him a crash course in Christmas during the town\u2019s Twelve Day Festival, that he might just change his mind about modernizing the Majestic.",

Hercules was the powerful son of the god king Zeus, for this he received nothing but suffering his entire life. After twelve arduous labors and the loss of his family, this dark, world-weary soul turned his back on the gods finding his only solace in bloody battle. Over the years he warmed to the company of six similar souls, their only bond being their love of fighting and presence of death. These men and woman never question where they go to fight or why or whom, just how much they will be paid. Now the King of Thrace has hired these mercenaries to train his men to become the greatest army of all time. It is time for this bunch of lost souls to finally have their eyes opened to how far they have fallen when they must train an army to become as ruthless and blood thirsty as their reputation has become.",
